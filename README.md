pysmb-fork
==========

Fork of pysmb 1.1.2
The purpose of this fork is to track any attempts at bug fixes while using the library.

The original project can be found at http://miketeo.net/wp/index.php/projects/pysmb
I will try to keep this repository updated as any new versions are released by the original author: Mike Teo.

pysmb is an experimental SMB/CIFS library written in Python.
It implements the client-side SMB/CIFS protocol (SMB1 and SMB2) which allows your Python application to access
and transfer files to/from SMB/CIFS shared folders like your Windows file sharing and Samba folders.
